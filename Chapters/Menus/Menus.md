## Menubar, Toolbar, Status Bar, and Context Menus
@cha_menus

Often application windows have a menubar that includes all commands provided by the application. Application windows may also have a toolbar, with buttons for commands that are used frequently. Some applications only have a toolbar. Apart from supporting a menubar and toolbar, Spec supports a status bar at the bottom of a window. Some widgets, such as text fields, tables, and lists, are equipped with context menus. All these aspects are the subject of this chapter.

We will build a small email client application. Apart from adding a menubar, a toolbar, a status bar, and a context menu, the example brings together much of what we have seen in the previous chapters. Figure *@MailClient@* shows the target application.
