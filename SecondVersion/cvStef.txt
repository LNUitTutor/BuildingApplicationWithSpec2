I'm an expert in object design, object language design, reflective programming, and the maintenance and evolution of large applications (visualization, metrics, meta-modeling). My work on traits has been introduced in AmbientTalk, Slate, Pharo, Perl-6, PHP 5.4 and Squeak. They have been ported to JavaScript. It has influenced the Scala and Fortress languages. I'm one of the founders of Pharo (http://www.pharo.org/), a new pure open-source object language inspired by Smalltalk. I head its industry consortium http://consortium.pharo.org. I'm one of the designers of Moose, an analysis platform (http://www.moosetechnology.org/). I was one of the founders of Synectique, a company offering dedicated analysis tools.
I'm interested in virtual machines and language implementation.

I have written several books on language-related subjects and other topics such as learning to program and web programming: some are available at http://books.pharo.org. I co-constructed a highly acclaimed Moocs on Pharo and object programming: http://mooc.pharo.org and https://advanced-design-mooc.pharo.org
I regularly work with companies such as Arolla, Berger-Levrault, Thales, Framatome, Siemens, CIM, Worldline.
I'm interested in understanding how to solve their challenges.
