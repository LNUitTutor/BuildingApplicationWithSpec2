Pay attention we have a version called inner to validate the cover (it has a number but it is not public and this is not an ISBN)

Once everything is ok we will create a new project with a (Public) ISBN. 

So 0218767862OfInnerVersion is a bod  for the non public version.

	
Especially since their computer said that the binding for 252 pages should be 1.51 cm 
So the canvas should be 

	(15,5 + 0,5) * 2 + 1,51 = 32 + 1.51 = 33,51 

To produce the PDF use export Canvas and change the canvas to be of the right size 
it will chop the pictures that is outside.
