Pay attention we have a version called inner to validate the cover (it has a number but it is not public and this is not an ISBN)

Once everything is ok we will create a new project with a (Public) ISBN. 

So 0218767862OfInnerVersion is a bod  for the non public version.

For the size of the binding part with 258 pages the bod web site is mentionning
	Dimensions totales avec fond perdu : 44.55 cm x 16.00 cm



I do not get how they get this 44.55

	44.55 - 2 * 22 = 0.55 cm 
	
Especially since their computer said that the binding for 258 pages should be 1.74 cm (which looks more reasonable to me.
